# dnd-api
API for Dungeons and Dragons 5th Edition

The idea of this project is to create a working RESTful API that can manage and support 5th Edition D&D functions.

# Character Management Service
This is a basic character management service that supports all the CRUD operations.
Steps:
- Flesh out a working domain (can always add more extraneous details later)
- Set up a repository service
- Create a CRUD service
- Build out the actual api
